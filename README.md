This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications when using API routes and `await` within page components.  The error arises from attempting to use `await` outside of an async function during server-side rendering.

**Problem:** The `about.js` file attempts to fetch data from an API route using `fetch` and `await`. However, the `fetch` call is not within an `async` function, leading to a runtime error.

**Solution:** The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a corrected version by wrapping the asynchronous operation within an `async` function, ensuring proper execution.

The `pages/api/data.js` file is a simple API route that returns a JSON response. This example focuses on resolving the `await` error;  more sophisticated error handling can be added for production-ready applications.
